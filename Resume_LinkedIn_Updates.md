## 📧 COVER LETTER: Project Paragraph

*Insert this paragraph in your Abbott cover letter:*

"To complement my on-premises big data experience at KSM, I recently built an AWS healthcare data pipeline demonstrating cloud-native architecture skills. The platform processes 70,000+ patient encounters through serverless Lambda functions, Glue PySpark ETL jobs, and a multi-zone S3 data lake. I implemented GDPR-compliant customer identification handling with automated PII detection and designed the infrastructure for cost efficiency at under $30 per month. This self-directed project shows my ability to quickly learn cloud technologies while applying data engineering principles and healthcare domain knowledge - exactly the combination Abbott needs for cloud-based RWE analytics."

## 🎯 TALKING POINTS FOR NETWORKING

### LinkedIn Messages to Recruiters

**Subject**: Data Engineer with Healthcare + AWS Experience

"Hi [Name],

I noticed Abbott's Data Engineer opening in Weesp. I'm currently a Data Engineer at KSM Research & Innovation working with 22 billion+ healthcare records, and I've recently expanded my skillset into AWS cloud technologies.

I built an end-to-end healthcare data pipeline on AWS (github.com/jaeljakobi/healthcare-aws-rwe-pipeline) that demonstrates:
• Serverless architecture (Lambda + Glue)
• PySpark distributed processing
• GDPR compliance implementation
• Cost-efficient design (<$30/month)

My combination of healthcare domain expertise and demonstrated cloud learning ability aligns well with Abbott's needs. I'd love to discuss how my background could contribute to your data platform team.

Best regards,
Jael"

### Informational Interview Talking Points

**When someone asks "What have you been working on?"**

"I'm currently at KSM Research working with massive healthcare datasets - over 22 billion records - but I've been expanding into cloud technologies. I built a complete AWS data pipeline for healthcare analytics that uses Lambda for serverless validation, Glue for PySpark ETL, and S3 as a data lake. The cool part is I designed it to be both production-grade and cost-efficient - the whole thing runs for under $30 a month. It's helped me understand how to translate on-premises big data concepts to cloud-native architecture, which is where the industry is heading."

## 🎤 ELEVATOR PITCH VARIATIONS

### **30-Second Version** (Networking events)
"I'm a healthcare data engineer working with 22 billion records at KSM Research. I recently built an AWS pipeline that processes patient data through serverless functions and PySpark ETL jobs - it handles 70,000 encounters for under $30 a month. I'm looking to bring this cloud expertise plus my healthcare domain knowledge to production-scale analytics."

### **60-Second Version** (Recruiter calls)
"I'm a Data Engineer at KSM Research working with Real-World Evidence analytics on 22 billion healthcare records. To expand my cloud skills, I built an AWS data pipeline that processes 70,000+ patient encounters through serverless Lambda functions and Glue PySpark ETL. The architecture uses a five-bucket S3 data lake with automated validation, GDPR compliance checking, and intelligent data partitioning. I designed it with production patterns - Infrastructure as Code, cost optimization, monitoring - and it runs for under $30 per month. This project demonstrates I can apply data engineering principles to cloud-native architecture while maintaining the healthcare domain expertise I've developed at KSM."

### **2-Minute Version** (Technical interviews)
"I work at KSM Research & Innovation managing healthcare data pipelines for Real-World Evidence studies. We process over 22 billion records using on-premises tools like HDFS, Impala, and Talend. While that's given me strong foundations in big data and healthcare analytics, I wanted to learn cloud-native architecture, so I built an AWS data pipeline.

The project processes 70,000+ patient encounters through multiple stages. First, serverless Lambda functions validate files as they're uploaded to S3 - checking format, size, and location in about 1.6 milliseconds. A second Lambda detects file formats and tags them. A third scans for Personal Identifiable Information for GDPR compliance.

Then a Glue PySpark job converts CSV to Parquet with intelligent partitioning - patients by gender and birth year, encounters by class and year. This gives us 60% storage reduction and 70% faster queries through columnar format and partition pruning.

I designed the whole infrastructure with production practices: IAM least-privilege roles, CloudWatch monitoring, cost optimization. The monthly cost is under $30 despite processing real workloads because it's fully serverless.

What excites me about Abbott is the opportunity to apply both my healthcare data expertise and these cloud engineering skills at production scale on your data platform."
